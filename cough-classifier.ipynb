The data comes from the Embeded Systems Lab at EPFL and thus is private. The data originates from 16 subjects whose audio signals were recorded by a device designed at EPFL.\n","\n","The cough classifier is a neural network based on CNN. The chosen preprocessing of the audio signals is STFT. Due to the low amount of data, data augmentation is crucial. Therefore, more data is produced doing time shifting and splitting each audio file into sounds of 0.7 seconds. This window length was abritarily chosen. It, however, effects the performance of the model, thus one can do a subsequent study on finding the optimal window length."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":4002,"status":"ok","timestamp":1671018347344,"user":{"displayName":"Simon Maurice Pierre Aquarone","userId":"12423164211060938573"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"xLVcpT34Udx0"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Requirement already satisfied: librosa in c:\\users\\sidla\\appdata\\local\\programs\\python\\python310\\lib\\site-packages (0.9.2)\n","Requirement already satisfied: decorator>=4.0.10 in c:\\users\\sidla\\appdata\\local\\programs\\python\\python310\\lib\\site-packages (from librosa) (5.1.1)\n","Requirement already satisfied: resampy>=0.2.2 in c:\\users\\sidla\\appdata\\local\\programs\\python\\python310\\lib\\site-packages (from librosa) (0.4.2)\n","Requirement already satisfied: pooch>=1.0 in c:\\users\\sidla\\appdata\\local\\programs\\python\\python310\\lib\\site-packages (from librosa) (1.6.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: scikit-learn>=0.19.1 in c:\\users\\sidla\\appdata\\local\\programs\\python\\python310\\lib\\site-packages (from librosa) (1.2.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: soundfile>=0.10.2 in c:\\users\\sidla\\appdata\\local\\programs\\python\\python310\\lib\\site-packages (from librosa) (0.11.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: joblib>=0.14 in c:\\users\\sidla\\appdata\\local\\programs\\python\\python310\\lib\\site-packages (from librosa) (1.2.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: numba>=0.45.1 in c:\\users\\sidla\\appdata\\local\\programs\\python\\python310\\lib\\site-packages (from librosa) (0.56.4)\n","Requirement already satisfied: audioread>=2.1.9 in c:\\users\\sidla\\appdata\\local\\programs\\python\\python310\\lib\\site-packages (from librosa) (3.0.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: numpy>=1.17.0 in c:\\users\\sidla\\appdata\\local\\programs\\python\\python310\\lib\\site-packages (from librosa) (1.23.1)\n","Requirement already satisfied: packaging>=20.0 in c:\\users\\sidla\\appdata\\local\\programs\\python\\python310\\lib\\site-packages (from librosa) (21.3)\n","Requirement already satisfied: scipy>=1.2.0 in c:\\users\\sidla\\appdata\\local\\programs\\python\\python310\\lib\\site-packages (from librosa) (1.9.3)\n","Requirement already satisfied: setuptools in c:\\users\\sidla\\appdata\\local\\programs\\python\\python310\\lib\\site-packages (from numba>=0.45.1->librosa) (58.1.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: llvmlite<0.40,>=0.39.0dev0 in c:\\users\\sidla\\appdata\\local\\programs\\python\\python310\\lib\\site-packages (from numba>=0.45.1->librosa) (0.39.1)\n","Requirement already satisfied: pyparsing!=3.0.5,>=2.0.2 in c:\\users\\sidla\\appdata\\local\\programs\\python\\python310\\lib\\site-packages (from packaging>=20.0->librosa) (3.0.9)\n","Requirement already satisfied: requests>=2.19.0 in c:\\users\\sidla\\appdata\\local\\programs\\python\\python310\\lib\\site-packages (from pooch>=1.0->librosa) (2.28.1)\n","Requirement already satisfied: appdirs>=1.3.0 in c:\\users\\sidla\\appdata\\local\\programs\\python\\python310\\lib\\site-packages (from pooch>=1.0->librosa) (1.4.4)\n","Requirement already satisfied: threadpoolctl>=2.0.0 in c:\\users\\sidla\\appdata\\local\\programs\\python\\python310\\lib\\site-packages (from scikit-learn>=0.19.1->librosa) (3.1.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: cffi>=1.0 in c:\\users\\sidla\\appdata\\local\\programs\\python\\python310\\lib\\site-packages (from soundfile>=0.10.2->librosa) (1.15.1)\n","Requirement already satisfied: pycparser in c:\\users\\sidla\\appdata\\local\\programs\\python\\python310\\lib\\site-packages (from cffi>=1.0->soundfile>=0.10.2->librosa) (2.21)\n","Requirement already satisfied: certifi>=2017.4.17 in c:\\users\\sidla\\appdata\\local\\programs\\python\\python310\\lib\\site-packages (from requests>=2.19.0->pooch>=1.0->librosa) (2022.6.15)\n","Requirement already satisfied: idna<4,>=2.5 in c:\\users\\sidla\\appdata\\local\\programs\\python\\python310\\lib\\site-packages (from requests>=2.19.0->pooch>=1.0->librosa) (3.3)\n","Requirement already satisfied: urllib3<1.27,>=1.21.1 in c:\\users\\sidla\\appdata\\local\\programs\\python\\python310\\lib\\site-packages (from requests>=2.19.0->pooch>=1.0->librosa) (1.26.11)\n","Requirement already satisfied: charset-normalizer<3,>=2 in c:\\users\\sidla\\appdata\\local\\programs\\python\\python310\\lib\\site-packages (from requests>=2.19.0->pooch>=1.0->librosa) (2.1.0)\n"]},{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["WARNING: You are using pip version 22.0.4;
